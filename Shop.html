			Breathing Exercises
		</b>
		<p>
			Focus on taking deep breaths in and out through your mouth, feeling the air slowly fill your chest and belly and then slowly leave them again. Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a second, and then breathe out for a count of four.
		</p>
	</li>

		<b>
			Recognition
		</b>
		<p>
			By recognizing that you’re having a panic attack instead of a heart attack, you can remind yourself that this is temporary, it will pass, and that you’re OK.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>
			Close your eyes (dependent)
		</b>
		<p>
			Some panic attacks come from triggers that overwhelm you. If you’re in a fast-paced environment with a lot of stimuli, this can feed your panic attack.

			To reduce the stimuli, close your eyes during your panic attack. This can block out any extra stimuli and make it easier to focus on your breathing.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>
			Mindfulness
		</b>
		<p>
			Mindfulness can help ground you in the reality of what’s around you. Since panic attacks can cause a feeling of detachment or separation from reality, this can combat your panic attack as it’s approaching or actually happening.

			Focus on the physical sensations you are familiar with, like digging your feet into the ground, or feeling the texture of your jeans on your hands. These specific sensations ground you firmly in reality and give you something objective to focus on.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>
			Focus
		</b>
		<p>
			Some people find it helpful to find a single object to focus all of their attention on during a panic attack. Pick one object in clear sight and consciously note everything about it possible.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>
			Muscle relaxation
		</b>
		<p>
			Much like deep breathing, muscle relaxation techniques can help stop your panic attack in its tracks by controlling your body’s response as much as possible.

			Consciously relax one muscle at a time, starting with something simple like the fingers in your hand, and move your way up through your body.

			Muscle relaxation techniques will be most effective when you’ve practiced them beforehand.

		<b>
			Happy place
		</b>
		<p>
			What’s the most relaxing place in the world that you can think of? A sunny beach with gently rolling waves? A cabin in the mountains?

			Picture yourself there, and try to focus on the details as much as possible. Imagine digging your toes into the warm sand, or smelling the sharp scent of pine trees.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>
			Light exercise
		</b>
		<p>
			Endorphins keep the blood pumping in exactly the right away. It can help flood our body with endorphins, which can improve our mood. Because you’re stressed, choose light exercise that’s gentle on the body, like walking or swimming.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>
			Lavender
		</b>
		<p>
			Lavender is known for being soothing and stress-relieving. It can help your body relax. If you know you’re prone to panic attacks, keep some lavender essential oil on hand and put some on your forearms when you experience a panic attack. Breathe in the scent.

			You can also try drinking lavender or chamomile tea. Both are relaxing and soothing.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>
			Mantra
		</b>
		<p>
			Repeating a mantra internally can be relaxing and reassuring, and it can give you something to grasp onto during a panic attack.

			Whether it’s simply “This too shall pass,” or a mantra that speaks to you personally, repeat it on loop in your head until you feel the panic attack start to subside.
